# Microcontroller Projects

This repository contains a collection of **microcontroller-based projects** that I developed using a variety of hardware platforms, including **Red Pitaya**, **Atmel 8091-SAM**, **VHDL on Red Pitaya**, and **Arduino**. These projects cover a wide range of **communication protocols** and **sensor-based applications**, showcasing my hands-on experience with embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

## Project Overview
The projects in this repository span across different hardware and use various **communication protocols**. They involve sensors and peripherals, demonstrating my ability to work with different technologies in embedded systems. The code for these projects is written in **C**, and each project is platform-specific, meaning the code must be compiled and run on the respective hardware system.

### Key Technologies and Components:
- **Red Pitaya**: Used for advanced projects involving **VHDL**, signal processing, and complex systems.
- **Atmel 8091-SAM**: A powerful microcontroller used in various sensor-based applications.
- **Arduino**: For simple, quick prototypes and experimenting with **sensors** and **actuators**.
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - **I2C**: Used for communication with sensors and peripherals.
  - **SPI (Synchronous)**: For high-speed data transfer between microcontrollers and devices.
  - **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**: Used in both synchronous and asynchronous modes.
- **Sensors and Peripherals**:
  - **Light Sensors**
  - **Temperature Sensors**
  - **Distance Sensors**
  - **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**
  - **Buttons**: For user input and triggering actions.

## Project Details
Each of these projects utilizes specific **microcontroller libraries** designed for the respective platforms. The code for each project must be compiled on its respective system:
- **Red Pitaya projects** are compiled and executed on the **Red Pitaya** hardware.
- **Atmel 8091-SAM** projects are compiled and executed on the **Atmel 8091-SAM** microcontroller.
- **Arduino projects** are compiled and executed on the **Arduino** board.

These projects highlight my work in a range of applications, from **sensor data acquisition** to **signal processing** and communication.

## Technologies Used:
- **C Programming Language**: The primary language used for all projects.
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming and interfacing with microcontrollers.
- **Sensor Integration**: Working with various types of sensors like light, temperature, and distance.
- **Communication Protocols**: Implementing I2C, SPI, and UART communication.

## How to Run:
1. **Red Pitaya**: Compile and upload the code to the **Red Pitaya** hardware using the appropriate tools for **VHDL** or **C**.
2. **Atmel 8091-SAM**: Use the relevant **Atmel toolchain** to compile and load the code onto the **Atmel 8091-SAM** microcontroller.
3. **Arduino**: Use the **Arduino IDE** to compile and upload the code to the **Arduino** board.

### Notes:
- Each project is tailored to its respective hardware and will not work on other platforms without modification.
- The projects use a wide range of **communication modes** (synchronous and asynchronous) to interface with sensors and other hardware components.
